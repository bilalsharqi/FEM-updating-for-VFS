     MASS MATRIX NEEDED FOR EIGENVALUE ANALYSIS
     User information:
     The eigensolution module was given a purged (that is, nonexistent)
     mass or stiffness matrix.  Common causes include the deletion of mass
     density input on MATi entries, user restart errors in the superelement
     solution sequences, or when the auto-selection feature of generalized
     dynamic reduction (GDR) determines that there are no natural frequencies
     below FMAX.  It therefore sets the number of generalized coordinates to
     zero.  This condition can be detected from UIM 4181. An avoidance is
     to increase FMAX on the DYNRED Bulk Data entry. Provide mass matrix
     matrix generating data by any of several means including a mass density
     entry on material entries, concentrated masses, and g-type DMIG entries.
     Possibly no mass matrix is defined.  Check for the following:
     RHO entry on MATi
     NSM entry on element properties (i.e., PSHELL, PBAR)
     CONMi or CMASSi
     The program requires at least one of the above to compute the mass matrix.
     Incorrect cross-sectional properties may also lead to this error but
     typically show up as another error.
