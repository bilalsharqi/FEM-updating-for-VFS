 *** USER INFORMATION MESSAGE 4425 (PRTPRN)
     ONE OR MORE FATAL ERRORS HAVE OCCURRED.  THERE MAY BE MORE ERROR MESSAGES IN THE PRECEDING OUTPUT
     User information:
     One or more modules has found a fatal error condition.  A message is
     printed for each fatal error condition.  They have set a flag, which
     causes this message to be printed at the end of the run.  Error messages
     may occur anywhere in the output, so you should search your output for
     these errors (search for FATAL).
     This message is most likely when PARAM,ERROR,0 is used.  However,
     this error will be issued in superelement analysis if User Warning
     Message 4698 is also issued.
     In cyclic symmetry analysis, if no eigenvalues are found in the
     prescribed frequency range on the EIGR or EIGRL entry for the current
     harmonic, the run will not continue to the next harmonic and the message
     will result.  Instead of selecting a frequency range, input the desired
     number of modes.
